`Release 0.12.2`_ (2019-12-11)
------------------------------

Bug fix for 2 most recent releases: ``s/OSError/EnvironmentError/g``

This is a follow up to / bug fix for `release 0.12`_ and `release 0.12.1`_
where I accidentally used ``OSError`` when I should have used ``IOError`` or
the generic parent class ``EnvironmentError``. I've verified that
``EnvironmentError`` is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.

The last few releases clearly show the value of having an automated test suite
to guard against regressions, unfortunately due to the nature of the Negotiator
project I'm not quite sure how I would get a functional test suite up and
running on Travis CI.

It's definitely possible, and on my wish list, but it is one of the higher
hanging fruits on that -almost infinite- wish list, so don't hold your breath
ðŸ˜›.

`Release 0.12.1`_ (2019-12-09)
------------------------------

**Enable retry in guest CLI.**

This is a follow up to `release 0.12`_ because I neglected to add
``retry=True`` to the ``negotiator_guest.cli`` module in that
release (the new behavior is opt-in in the Python API so as to
improve backwards compatibility and make the API more foolproof).

.. _Release 0.12.1: https://github.com/xolox/python-negotiator/compare/0.12...0.12.1

`Release 0.12`_ (2019-12-05)
----------------------------

Retry character device access in guest agent when ``EBUSY`` error is reported.

At my employer we operate 200+ virtual servers that have Negotiator installed
and in recent months we've started building more and more monitoring on top of
Negotiator, resulting in hundreds of invocations per day. This is when I
started seeing intermittent errors like the following::

 IOError: [Errno 16] Device or resource busy: '/dev/vport2p2'

The new retry on ``EBUSY`` behavior is intended to minimize occurrences of such
race conditions.

`Release 0.11`_ (2019-10-11)
----------------------------

Fix error in error handling in ``negotiator-host``
 This resolves the traceback below when ``negotiator-host`` is running but
 'crashes' because ``virsh list`` fails because it can't connect to
 ``libvirtd``. This situation is still an unrecoverable error, but the
 intention was for it to be an unrecoverable error that did not produce a
 traceback...

 .. code-block:: none

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File ".../negotiator_host/cli.py", line 117, in main

Cleaned up flake8 F401 (imported but unused) warning
 As a result of moving to ``humanfriendly.compact()``.

Minor changes relating to Python versions
 Two minor changes relating to Python version compatibility:

 - Unbreak ``make docs`` (Sphinx insists on Python 3, and rightfully so).

 - Replace Python 2.6 reference in README with Python 2.7.

 Compatibility with Python 3 hasn't been verified but is more or less expected
 given a pure Python code base. Maybe a Unicode error slipped in here or there,
 as I said "to be verified".

.. _Release 0.11: https://github.com/xolox/python-negotiator/compare/0.10...0.11

`Release 0.10`_ (2019-03-03)
----------------------------

Clarify verbosity control
 Update the command line interface usage messages to clarify that the options
 ``--verbose`` and ``--quiet`` can be repeated (in response to `#1`_).

No traceback when guest discovery fails
 Don't log a traceback when guest discovery using the ``virsh list`` command
 fails, to avoid spamming the logs about a known problem. This change was made
 to counteract the following interaction:

 - The negotiator documentation specifically suggests to use a process
   supervision solution like supervisord_ to automatically restart the
   negotiator daemon when it dies.

 - When the libvirt daemon is down ``virsh list`` will fail and the negotiator
   daemon dies with a rather verbose traceback (before `release 0.10`_).

 - Because supervisord_ automatically restarts the negotiator daemon but
   doesn't know about the libvirt dependency, several restarts may be required
   to get the negotiator daemon up and running again.

 - This "restart until it stays up" interaction would result in quite a few
   useless tracebacks being logged which "polluted" the logs and might raise
   the impression that something is really broken (that can't be fixed by an
   automatic restart).

`Release 0.9`_ (2019-03-03)
---------------------------

Refactored channel discovery to use ``virsh list`` and ``virsh dumpxml``:

- The recent addition of Ubuntu 18.04 support proved once again that the
  old channel discovery strategy was error prone and hard to maintain.

- Since then it had come to my attention that on Ubuntu 18.04 guest names
  embedded in pathnames of UNIX sockets may be truncated in which case the
  domain id provides the only way to match a UNIX socket to its guest.

- Despite the previous point, I also wanted to maintain compatibility with
  libvirt releases that don't embed the domain id in the pathnames. Doing so
  based on the old channel discovery strategy would have become messy.

So I decided to take a big step back and opted for a new strategy that will
hopefully prove to be more robust and future proof. Thanks to `@tarmack`_ for
initially suggesting this approach.
